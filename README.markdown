This is an iphone application that helps locate citibikes in NYC. I created it because the alternatives are ugly or are not performant (no offense to their creators).

#### Installation

Checkout the repo:

```
git checkout git@github.com:josephmisiti/nyc-bike-finder.git
```

Install the pods:

```
pod install
```

Build and deploy from your iphone:

```
CMD+B & CMD+R
```
